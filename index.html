        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>CSS allows us to link external style sheets to our files. This helps us make changes to CSS separately and improves the page load time. External files are specified in link tag inside head of the document. Syntax. The syntax for including external CSS is as follows: 
          <br>
          link rel="stylesheet" href="#location" Example </li>
      <li>The period preceding " your title name" designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, "your title name", will gain property assignments from the CSS.</li>
     <li> Example: 
      <br>
      .your title name {
      <br>
      width: 80%;
      <br>
      margin: 60px auto;
      <br>
