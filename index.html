        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>The  p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages. In our Panda Fan Site, the following text is contained inside a p element</li>
      <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
      <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image. </li>
      <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>CSS allows us to link external style sheets to our files. This helps us make changes to CSS separately and improves the page load time. External files are specified in link tag inside head of the document. Syntax. The syntax for including external CSS is as follows: 
          <br>
          link rel="stylesheet" href="#location" Example </li>
      <li>The period preceding " your title name" designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, "your title name", will gain property assignments from the CSS.</li>
     <li> Example: 
      <br>
      .your title name {
      <br>
      width: 80%;
      <br>
      margin: 60px auto;
      <br>

     <ul>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
      <li>Make sure we are on the branch from our command line.</li>
      <li>Committing the changes is a simple command in Git. Just type the following command. git commit -m "This is my first commit"</li>
      <li>After you commit you push it by typing git push origin -u branch name. </li>
      <li>After you push commit, You go to git hub and merge it. </li>
      <li>After you merge it on git hub you go to git bash and type git checkout main. </li>
      <li>After you checkout main then you git pull on git bash by type git pull</li>
      <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
      <li>To switch Git branches, enter the following command: git checkout new branch name.</li>
      <li>To add the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git. Enter the following command to stage the changes: git add -A but you can also do  this in vs code.</li>
      <li>Now that all of our changes have been staged, we can commit to our repository. Enter the following command to commit our changes: git commit -m "added CSS to project"</li>
      <li>Next, let's make sure our current branch is up to date before opening a pull request. Enter the following command: git pull origin main</li>
      <li>Let's push up all of our changes by entering the following command: git push origin feature/add-css</li>
      <li>Let's make sure we update our local main branch now. Back in the command line, navigate to the main branch by entering the following Git command: git check out main</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
   <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Add JavaScript File to the Repo
          Complete the following steps to create a feature branch and add a JavaScript file to the prework-study-guide repo:
          In the command line, navigate to the prework-study-guide directory.
          Check what branch you are currently on by running git status.
          If you are not on the main branch, run git checkout main to switch to the main branch.
          Pull the remote main branch into the local main branch by running git pull origin main. Now your local and remote main branches are in sync!
          Create a new feature branch for the JavaScript file by entering git checkout -b feature/add-js into the command line.
          Navigate to the assets/ folder in the project repo by entering cd assets in the command line. This is the same folder where we added the style.css file in the previous lesson.
          Create a new file inside the assets folder called script.js by entering touch script.js in the command line.
         In VS Code, open the prework-study-guide directory, and then open the script.js file.</li>
         <li>Open index.html in VS Code and add the following code under the footer element and above the closing element for body </li>
        <li> script src="./assets/script.js" /script </li>
        <li>Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just if. In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition—just like we did in the dishes pseudocode—by using else if, as demonstrated in the following code example:</li>
        <li>if (first condition) {
          <br>
          // block of code to be executed if first condition is truthy
          <br>
       } else if (second condition) {
        <br>
          // block of code to be executed if second condition is truthy
          <br>
       }</li>
      <li>The following is an example of an if statement:
        <br>
        if (0) {
          <br>
           console.log("I'm 0!")
           <br>
        } else if (null) {
          <br>
           console.log("I'm null!")
           <br>
        } else if (true) {
          <br>
           console.log("I'm true!")
           <br>
        }</li>
        <li>Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
          <br>
          Often this is the case when working with arrays:</li>
          <li>for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
            text += cars[i] + "<br>";
          }</li>
          <li>https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
